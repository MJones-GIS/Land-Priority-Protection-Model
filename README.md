Summary:
The GIS parcel prioritization tool known as, the Land Priority Protection Model (LPPM) 
utilizes Model Builder within ArcMap 10.6 to target private land and quickly analyzes
conservation criteria to weight, rank, and strategically score parcels to identify 
areas of land best suited for conservation. The fundamental components of the LPPM are 
the decision-support criteria. The three overarching evaluation criteria for identifying 
potential parcels of high value are: presence of streams, adjacency to existing protection, 
and presence of desirable land cover/land use (land cover/land use types to include wetland, 
forest, and agriculture use). Each criteria are evaluated within their own sub-models, 
calculated individually. The final conservation model is computed last to accommodate all 
other criteria calculations. While the primary purpose of the model results are to evaluate 
high priority land to apply conservation easements, versatility is the secondary purpose; 
at any time, variables can be excluded or weighted differently.
